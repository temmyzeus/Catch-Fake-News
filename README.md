# No-Toxic
An API that tells the probabilty toxivity in a sentence!!

This was supposed to be a Fake-Nes-Classifiaction project but the concept of classifiying fake news is based on factors like location, sector, country, source
so I changes it to a **No_Toxic** to get the probabilty of a sentence beinng toxic on 5 different labels.
